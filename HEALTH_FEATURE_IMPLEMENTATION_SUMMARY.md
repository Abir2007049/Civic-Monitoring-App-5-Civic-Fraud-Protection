## üìä Technical Specifications

### Detection Algorithm
- **Keyword Matching**: Pattern-based detection across 5 categories
- **Priority Scoring**: High-priority categories weighted more heavily
- **Confidence Calculation**: Based on number and type of matches
- **Context Awareness**: Categories determine recommendation type

### Data Flow
```
Text Input ‚Üí Keyword Analysis ‚Üí Risk Scoring ‚Üí 
Category Classification ‚Üí Recommendation Generation ‚Üí 
Alert Storage (if High/Medium) ‚Üí Display Results
```

### Storage
- **Alert Type**: "Health Risk"
- **Data Saved**: Risk level, message, keywords, categories, timestamp
- **Database**: SQLite via AppDatabase
- **Privacy**: Only alerts stored, not full message content

### Performance
- **Analysis Speed**: < 100ms for typical messages
- **Memory**: Lightweight, minimal overhead
- **Battery**: Efficient keyword matching
- **Network**: None required (100% offline)
