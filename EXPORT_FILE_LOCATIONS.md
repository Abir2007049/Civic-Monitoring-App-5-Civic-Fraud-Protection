3. Try exporting again

### **"Permission Denied"**
**Cause:** File manager can't access certain folders
**Solution:**
1. Try a different file manager app
2. Use the search function instead of browsing
3. Check Downloads folder first (most accessible)

### **"Files Exist But Can't Open"**
**Cause:** Need JSON viewer
**Solution:**
1. Install any text editor app
2. Or share file to PC/email
3. Files are human-readable JSON

## 💡 **Pro Tips**

1. **Always check Downloads first** - most accessible location
2. **Use search instead of browsing** - faster and more reliable  
3. **Multiple exports create multiple files** - doesn't overwrite
4. **Files are shareable** - can email, upload to cloud, transfer to PC
5. **App shows exact path** when export succeeds

## 🎯 **Quick Test**

To verify export is working:

1. **Open the app**
2. **Dashboard → Analyze a number** (try: +1800SPAM99)
3. **Menu → Data Management → Export Data**
4. **Look for success message with file path**
5. **Use that exact path to find your file**

The export will now save to **multiple accessible locations** and show you exactly where it saved! 🚀
